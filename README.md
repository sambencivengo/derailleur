## Derailleur

An upcoming forum/platform for all kinds of bicycle enthusiasts.

Currently deployed [here](https://derailleur.vercel.app/).

### Description

This platform is intended to provide a one-stop-shop for all things cycling with a focus on bicycle touring & bikepacking, alt-cycling, rebuilding or refurbishing vintage frames and more.

User's can create accounts and with those accounts they can create posts about recent trips, bike builds, mechanical questions, etc.

On each post, the user can add tags (like hashtags) that will help other user's find similar posts.

If you desire, you can upload a route from [Ride WithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/). If one does this, the route will be embedded in their post along with receiving a special ROUTE tag.

User's can save posts they like and contribute to the conversation by commenting on posts or replying to other comments. Post and replies can be edited by their creator wherever they are found on the application.
